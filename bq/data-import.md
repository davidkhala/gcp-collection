- The [CompilerWorks platform](https://cloud.google.com/find-a-partner/partner/compilerworks) is used to analyze, convert and optimize data processing code. There are two basic use cases:
  - Migrating your SQL code (DML, views, DDL, Scripts, ETL) from legacy systems to BigQuery.
  - Managing and optimizing your code on BigQuery, including both performance and cost reduction.
  - Drawbacks: The company doesn't exsit anymore.
