## Connect
- querying data directly from GCS and Google Drive.
  - AVRO, JSON NL, CSV files
  - Google Cloud Datastore backup 
- Google Sheets (first tab only)
- If native support is not yet available for the BI layer in use, Google has partnered with [Simba Technologies](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/odbc-jdbc-drivers) to provide ODBC and JDBC drivers. This extends connection support including
  - MS Excel (preferred than [bigquery-connector-for-excel](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/bigquery-connector-for-excel))
